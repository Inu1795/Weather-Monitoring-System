# Weather-Monitoring-System
A simulation based weather monitoring system using Proteus 8 and Arduino IDE
I completed this as a part of my penultimate year mini project, where in i used proteus 8 professional software for designing the circuit, physical circuit board layout and then the final simulation part. 
ATMEGA32p is the microcontroller which was used as the interfacing device with the three other sensors namely DHT11 for temperature and humidity, MPX4115a for the pressure and rain sensor for the rain parameter. 
coding part was executed on arduino IDE for the same and hex file was generated and embedded in the software for it. 
You can find even the full presentation video for the same.



You can find the images and code for the same in files.
